# GlassEffectConfiguration

<TypeHeader/>

## Overview

The parameters used when configuring a glass effect for a blur view. Glass effects are
an alternative to classic blur views introduced in iOS 26, providing a more modern and
visually appealing blur effect with additional customization options.

The glass effect requires at least the `style` property to be set. On iOS versions prior
to 26, setting this property will have no effect.
