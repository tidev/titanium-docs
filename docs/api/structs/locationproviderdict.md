## Overview

The `accuracy` and `power` values correspond to constants defined in the
Android API. See
[android.location.Criteria](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Criteria.html)
in the Android API Reference.

These values are generalizations. In general, a provider with coarse accuracy will
provide less accurate results than a provider with fine accuracy, and a provider with
high power requirements will use more battery power than a provider with low power
requirements.
