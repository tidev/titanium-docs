## Overview

The API for this module is based on the W3C DOM specification.

Android and iOS implement the [DOM Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html) specification
with some non-standard extensions, which are documented in the appropriate places.

Both iOS and Android lack DTD support.
