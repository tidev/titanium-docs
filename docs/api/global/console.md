# Console

<ProxySummary/>

## Overview

The toplevel `console` support is intended to supplement Titanium.API and make it easier for developers to port existing javascript code (especially CommonJS modules) to Titanium.

Note that `console` does not currently implement the complete [Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Console) specification. See the following supported methods for details and submit a pull request to add more!
