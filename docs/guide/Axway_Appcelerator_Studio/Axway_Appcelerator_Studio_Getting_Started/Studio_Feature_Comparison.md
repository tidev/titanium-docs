# Studio Feature Comparison

## Overview

Appcelerator and Titanium Studio are extended versions of [Aptana Studio](http://www.aptana.com/), the professional, open-source, Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tool for web development. In addition to Aptana Studio's web features, Titanium Studio adds the opportunity to develop Appcelerator Titanium Mobile projects.

\*Refer to [Adding PHP Ruby or Python Support](/guide/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio_Getting_Started/Adding_PHP_Ruby_or_Python_Support/) for installing these add-on modules. As they are so closely related, we often use the term "Studio" to refer to Appcelerator, Titanium, and Aptana Studio together.

When updating or adding Eclipse plugins or software, the software repository varies with the version of Studio:

| Appcelerator/Titanium Studio Version | Eclipse Repository Name | Eclipse Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.1.x | Helios | 3.6 |
| 3.0.x - 3.1.3 | Indigo | 3.7 |
| 3.1.4 - 3.4.x | Kepler | 4.3 |
| 4.0.0 - latest | Luna | 4.4 |

## Appcelerator Studio

Appcelerator Studio extends the features of Titanium Studio to help manage your mobile project through its entire lifecycle and develop your application more efficiently. Appcelerator Studio provides additional services, such as code profiling to find performance bottlenecks in your application, live view to help design application, and code analysis, to help you write better code. Additionally, Appcelerator Studio helps integrate cloud, automated testing, analytics, and crash reporting services, which can be monitored by the [Appcelerator Dashboard](http://platform.appcelerator.com).

## Titanium Studio

Titanium Studio makes it easy to get started with a mobile project built upon the Titanium SDK to produce professional cross-platform mobile applications. It includes integrated templates, sample applications, and vast amounts of educational material to ensure that you are always building on your skills. It helps you to manage your Titanium projects, including writing, developing and integrating add-on modules, debugging, integrating with [cloud services](http://www.appcelerator.com/cloud), testing, packaging, and deploying.

## Aptana Studio

Aptana Studio includes a multitude of web coding features, which aid in the authoring of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby languages. It supports the latest specifications, such as CSS3 and HTML5, with information about the level of support for each element in the major web browsers, as well as code assist, command completion, and code syntax validation.

It features integrated Ruby and JavaScript debuggers that allow you to set breakpoints, control execution, and inspect variables, which results in a far better understanding of your code in action and quicker bug resolution.

Working seamlessly with the popular Version Control System, [Git](http://git-scm.com/), it facilitates Git-based deployments.

Studio also includes a deployment wizard that provides one of the fastest and easiest ways to publish your applications. It supports all the most widely used protocols, such as FTP, SFTP, FTPS, and Capistrano, and works with Rails and 3rd-party hosting platforms, such as [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) and [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com/).
