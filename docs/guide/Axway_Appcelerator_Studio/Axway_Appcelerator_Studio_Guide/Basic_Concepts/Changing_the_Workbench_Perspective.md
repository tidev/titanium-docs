# Changing the Workbench Perspective

When you are using Studio, you need to ensure you are using the Studio Perspective, to take full advantage of all of Studio's features. A Perspective is a collection of Eclipse views and editors, configured for specific tasks. This page describes how to change your perspective in your workbench.

**To change your workbench perspective:**

* From the menu bar, select **Window** > **Open** **Perspective**.

    * If the perspective you want is visible, select it.

    * If not, select **Other...** to display a dialog that shows all available perspectives. Select the one you want, then click **OK**.

You can also open the perspective dialog by clicking the **Open Perspective** button ![IconPerspective](./IconPerspective.png) in the top-right corner of Studio. To the right of the **Open Perspective** button are the perspectives you use frequently. Click these buttons to change the perspective.

For example, with the Debug Perspective, Studio opens additional views as shown in the screenshot below: Debug, Variables, Breakpoints, Expressions, and Loaded Scripts views.
