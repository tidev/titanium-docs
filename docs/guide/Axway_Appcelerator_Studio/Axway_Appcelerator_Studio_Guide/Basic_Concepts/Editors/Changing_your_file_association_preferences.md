# Changing your file association preferences

## Overview

This page describes how you can use Studio, even if you are developing with ASP or other languages not yet supported.

By default, you can use Studio to create and edit JS, CSS, HTML, PHP, Ruby, XML, and other files. However, you can use the various Studio Editors with other file types, such as ASP files, by configuring support for those file types.

## For non-Studio file types

1. Select **Preferences...**, and then choose **General > Editors > File Associations**.

2. Add the appropriate file type.

    1. Next to the **File Types** list, click the **Add...** button.

    2. In the **New File Type** pop-up window, type the appropriate file extension (e.g. "\*.asp").

    3. Click **OK** to add the New File Type to the List.

3. Associate the new file type with Studio.

    1. On the **File Types** list, select the file type that you just added.

    2. Next to the **Associated editors** list, click the **Add...** button.

    3. On the **Editor Selection** pop-up window, select the editor that you want to associate with your file type.

    4. Click **OK** to add the editor.
        The new is now associated with the specified file type.

4. Click **OK** to apply your changes and close the **Preferences** window.

## To set a new default editor

1. Select **Preferences...**, and then choose **General > Editors > File Associations**.

    1. Next to the **Associated editors** list, select the editor you wish to be the default editor.
