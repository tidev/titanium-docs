# About Content Assist

## Overview

Use Content Assist to complete your code statements faster and with more accuracy. Content Assist provides pop-up help to help you complete your code statements. (This feature is similar to the Content Assist, and Intellisense features used in other IDE products.)

## Using Content Assist

If you are typing the name of an object (for example, "document"), when you type the period (".") to call either a method or access a property for that object, Content Assist pops up a small window displaying the available methods and properties for that object (shown below). You can also type **ctrl + space** to access Content Assist at any time.

If you are calling a method on that object, when you type the first open parenthesis ("("), Studio will automatically create the closing parenthesis (")") for you, and Content Assist will pop up a small window with the parameters that the method takes (shown below).

Using Content Assist is simple. When the Content Assist window pops up, double-click the property or function that you want to use with the object that you just typed. Studio will automatically complete the word after the period for you.

## Adding your code to Content Assist

You can also use Content Assist with your objects and functions. For example, when you call a function that you have already coded, Content Assist can help you with parameters and return types.

To use Content Assist with your code, you will need to document your code. To learn more about setting up Content Assist and ScriptDoc, see [Setting up Content Assist using ScriptDoc](/guide/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio_Guide/Web_Development/JavaScript_Development/Documenting_Code/Setting_up_Content_Assist_using_ScriptDoc/).
