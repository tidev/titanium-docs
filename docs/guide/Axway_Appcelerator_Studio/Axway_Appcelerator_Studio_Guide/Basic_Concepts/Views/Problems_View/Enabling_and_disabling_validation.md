# Enabling and disabling validation

This page explains how to enable and disable validation in your Problems View.

## Introduction

The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Editors in Studio validate the code that you write against the specifications defined in HTMLTidy, CSSTidy, and JSLint, respectively. Any code that you write that cannot be validated against these tools triggers an error message in the Problems View.

## To modify current validation preferences

1. Select **Preferences > Studio > Validation**

2. Choose the language you are interested in modifying

3. Check/uncheck the validator you are interested in modifying

4. Click **OK**
