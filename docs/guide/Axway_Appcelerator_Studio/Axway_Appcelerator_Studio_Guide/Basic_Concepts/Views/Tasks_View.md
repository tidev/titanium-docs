# Tasks View

This page gives an overview of the Tasks View.

## Introduction

The Tasks View provides a "to-do" list for you of tasks for the projects in your workspace. These tasks are not automated or connected to anything; a task list simply helps you track what you need to get done.

## Opening the view

::: tip
* From the _Window_ menu, select _Show View > Tasks_.

* To close the _Tasks View_, click the Close button (**X**) in the upper right of the tab.
:::

Studio will display the **Tasks View** as a tab at the bottom of your screen, as shown in the image below.

## Editing the Task keywords

Define your tags that will add a task to the task list in **Preferences... > Studio > Tasks**.

The keywords **TODO**, **FIXME**, and **XXX** are defined as task tags by default.
