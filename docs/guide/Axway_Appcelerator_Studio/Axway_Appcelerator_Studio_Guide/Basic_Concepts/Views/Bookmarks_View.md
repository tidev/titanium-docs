# Bookmarks View

This page explains what the Bookmarks View is and how to display it.

## Introduction

The Bookmarks View lists all of your bookmarks in all of your open projects. Add bookmarks to places in your code that you think you will want to access quickly or often.

Double-click any bookmark in the Bookmarks View to immediately jump to that spot in your code. (The file containing the bookmark does not need to be open. Aptana will open the file in the editor for you.)

## Opening the View

To display the Bookmarks View:

::: tip
* From the **Window** menu, select **Show View > Other...**, and in the Show View window, select **General > Bookmarks**.

* To close the **Bookmarks View**, click the Close button (**X**) in the upper right of the tab.
:::

Studio displays the **Bookmark View** as a tab at the bottom of your screen, shown in the image below.

## Adding a Bookmark

To add a bookmark to your code:

1. Click on the line of code where you want to add the bookmark.

2. From the **Edit** menu, select **Add Bookmark...** from the context menu to open an **Add Bookmark** pop-up window.

3. On the **Add Bookmark** pop-up window, type the name that you want to give to the bookmark.

Aptana creates the bookmark for you, which now appears in the Bookmarks View.

To quickly jump to the bookmark, double-click the bookmark in the Bookmark View.
