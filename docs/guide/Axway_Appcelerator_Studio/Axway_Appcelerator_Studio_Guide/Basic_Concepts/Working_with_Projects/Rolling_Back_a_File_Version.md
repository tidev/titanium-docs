# Rolling Back a File Version

You can roll back the version of a file in your projects to an earlier version by replacing the current file version with another version from the local file history.

To roll back the version of a file:

1. In the **Project Explorer** View, right-click on the file whose history you want to display, or right-click the file currently open in the editor.

2. From the pop-up context menu, select **Replace With > Local History...** to open a **Compare** pop-up window. (To roll the file back only one version, you can select **Replace With > Previous from Local History**, and Studio will automatically revert the file to the previously saved version.)

3. On the top part of the **Compare** window, select the date/time that corresponds to the version with which you want to replace the current version. You can preview the changes by double-clicking the date/time, and Studio will display the changes in the bottom part of the window.

4. Click the **Replace** button to replace the current file with the selected version.
