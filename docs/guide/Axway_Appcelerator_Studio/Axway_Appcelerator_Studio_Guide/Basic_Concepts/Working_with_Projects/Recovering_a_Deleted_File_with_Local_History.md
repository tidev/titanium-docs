# Recovering a Deleted File with Local History

Although you will usually use the Local History feature to compare versions of a file that you are editing, you can also use it as a last resort for recovering a deleted file if you cannot find a copy of that file anywhere else on your system. You will have to have been working on the file using the **Project Explorer** View for this technique to work.

To recover a deleted file using Local History:

1. In the **Project Explorer** View, locate the project where the file used to be, then create an empty file with the same name and extension as the deleted file.

2. Right-click the empty file and select **Replace With > Previous from Local History**.

The Local History feature will replace the content of the empty file with the content from the last version of the file in Studio.
