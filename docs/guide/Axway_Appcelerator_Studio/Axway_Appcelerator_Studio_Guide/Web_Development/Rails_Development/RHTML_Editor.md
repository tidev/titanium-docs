# RHTML Editor

This page gives an overview of the RHTML Editor in Aptana Rails.

## Introduction

The Aptana Rails RHTML Editor is based on the Aptana HTML Editor. The RHTML Editor features context-sensitive Code Assist, syntax coloring, and other standard Aptana Editor features. The RHTML Editor can determine whether you are coding in HTML, CSS Javascript, or ERB ruby snippets within a file and act accordingly. The Editor also offers Rails-specific code completion. It can recognize instance variables in the matching action, helper methods in the matching helper, and helper methods included by Rails.
