# Servers

Studio allows you to specify existing servers you have installed on your machine to start/stop those servers, as well as to hook them up to be used as Preview sources for specific projects. We do this through the **Servers** View.

## Displaying the Servers View

From the **Window** menu, select the **Show Views** submenu and choose **Servers.**
