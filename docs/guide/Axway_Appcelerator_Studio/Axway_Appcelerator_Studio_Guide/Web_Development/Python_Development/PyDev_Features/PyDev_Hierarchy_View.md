# Hierarchy View

In PyDev, you can use **F4** to open the hierarchy view for you while over some class definition.

The Hierarchy View allows you to check a class hierarchy, seeing the relations as well as methods and attributes for all the classes in the hierarchy.

After opening the hierarchy view, you can:

* **Single-click** a class: will show you the class methods

* **Double-click** a class, method, or attribute: will open that definition in the editor.

* **Zoom**: Right-Click the view and move your mouse left/right

* **Pan**: Lef-Click the view and move your mouse as you wish
