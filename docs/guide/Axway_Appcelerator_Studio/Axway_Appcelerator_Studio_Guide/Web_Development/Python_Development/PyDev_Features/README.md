**Notes:**

* **PyLint**: PyLint is provided by logilab, and does code-analysis in python programs. It is called when a file is saved. It is written in python itself and called as an external program.

Many other features provided by Eclipse itself are not added to the list but are available either in the Eclipse platform or in other third-party plugins. Below is a 'quick-list' of 'recommendations' that may be worth mentioning...

| Plug-in features / recommendations | Plug-in |
| --- | --- |
| Text code-completion (also known as emacs-style completion) | Alt+/ in Eclipse |
| Rectangular editing | Ctrl+Shift+A in Eclipse 3.5 |
| Open selected folder with an explorer from within Eclipse | [Easy Explore](http://easystruts.sourceforge.net/) |
| CVS, subversion and many other 'repository systems' are available | Search the net for what you want |
