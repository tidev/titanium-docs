# Accessing your debugger log

## Introduction

Just like Studio has a log file to help diagnose bugs, the JavaScript debugger has an error log that you can access through Firefox or IE. If you think you find a bug in the debugger, you can post the log contents to the forums to help the support team troubleshoot the issue.

## Instructions

You will need to have installed the debugger into your browser to be able to access your log. See [Installing the JavaScript debugger](#undefined) or [Installing the Internet Explorer debugger](#undefined) for installation help.

2. In the **Extensions** pop-up window, select the **Aptana Debugger Service**.

3. Click the **Options** button to open an **Aptana Studio Debugger Preferences** pop-up window.

4. To the right of the path for the **Error Log**, click the **View** button to display the Error Log.
