# Filtering Content Assist by Supported Platforms

Studio allows you to only show API functionality available across all platforms. To tweak these settings, you can adjust the content assist preferences.

## Introduction

When typing in the JavaScript editor, you can have Studio show you which API items are available on a particular platform. The default settings for each project nature may be tweaked to suit your particular situation.
