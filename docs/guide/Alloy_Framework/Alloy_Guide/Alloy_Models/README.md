# Alloy Models

::: warning ⚠️ Warning
IMPORTANT NOTE – PLEASE READ

Currently, Alloy is using Backbone version 0.9.2, which is not the most current version of Backbone. The documentation links in the Model guides link to version 0.9.2 of the Backbone documentation. If you go to the official Backbone site, the documentation might be out-of-sync with these guides.
:::

Alloy uses Backbone.js to provide support for its models and collections. Alloy also borrows the concepts of migrations and adapters from Rails for storage integration.

For models, collections and sync adapters, these guides only provides information on how Alloy utilizes the Backbone.js functionality and some simple examples of using it. For most cases and additional information, refer to the [Backbone.js documentation](http://docs.appcelerator.com/backbone/0.9.2/).
