# Studio Compatibility Matrix

## Disk space

We recommend the following as a guideline for estimating how much disk space is necessary to build applications:

| Application | Recommended disk space | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Xcode | 15 - 20GB | Xcode includes the latest iOS and related simulator(s). |
| Android Studio | 10 - 15GB | You may need to select with SDK(s), NDK(s), and emulators to use. |
| Mobile app (workspace) | 50MB - 3GB | Disk usage depends on many factors. |
