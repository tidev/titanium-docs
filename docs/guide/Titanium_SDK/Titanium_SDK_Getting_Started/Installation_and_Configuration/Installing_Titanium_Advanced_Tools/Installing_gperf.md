## Compatibility and Download

The GNU gperf utility is used for generating hash functions. It is used when you build the Titanium SDK from source. It is not needed for Titanium app or module builds.

The gperf tool is installed as part of the Xcode command-line tools, but you may need to install it on Windows.

gperf is not required for building, running, or distributing applications using the Titanium SDK.

Obtain the latest stable version of gperf.
