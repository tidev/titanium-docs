# Titanium SDK Getting Started

## Overview

This guide walks through the steps of installing and configuring your favorite IDE and third-party SDKs and tools required to develop native mobile applications. You can integrate the Titanium command-line tools into your environment (see [Setting up the Titanium CLI](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference/) for instructions).

## Prerequisites

Your system environment must meet the following requirements:

* **Operating System:** A recent version of Windows or Mac OS X

* **Memory:** 8 GB RAM minimum system memory (2 GB RAM available memory). 16 GB RAM recommended.

* **Java Runtime:** Oracle JDK (no other brand of Java is suitable)

* **Node.js:** Required for the Titanium command-line tools like the CLI or Alloy

For more details, please refer to [Prerequisites](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Prerequisites/) document.

For a complete list of compatibility of system environments, dependencies, and other requirements, please review [Titanium Compatibility Matrix](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix/) document.

## Download and install an IDE

Our recommendations for an IDE, are to use VSCode or Atom. There exists specific extensions for both, so choose what you prefer.

* Official TiDev Titanium extension for VSCode: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tidev.titanium-sdk](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tidev.titanium-sdk).

* Official TiDev Titanium extension for Atom: [https://github.com/tidev/atom-appcelerator-titanium](https://github.com/tidev/atom-appcelerator-titanium).

### Installing the platform SDKs

To develop native applications with Titanium you need the SDKs and tools for those native platforms installed on your system. For example, to develop Android applications you need the Android SDK and toolchain installed, and for iOS (only available in a MacOS system) you need the iOS SDK.

For detailed instructions, see [Installing Platform SDKs](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Installing_Platform_SDKs/).

## First Titanium app
