## Summary

In this section, you explored some of the resources available to Titanium Developers, including developer tools, documentation, example code, and multiple sources of developer support. To make full use of these, though, you'll need to gain a level of competency with the Javascript language. In the final section of this chapter you'll get a crash course in Javascript development, giving you the knowledge necessary to build your first mobile app with Titanium.
