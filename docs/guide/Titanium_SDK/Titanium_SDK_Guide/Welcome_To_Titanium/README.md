# Welcome To Titanium

Titanium's unique trait among the various available cross-platform mobile solutions is that it creates truly native apps. This is in contrast to web-based solutions that deliver functionality via an enhanced web view. Titanium, not wanting to be limited by the native web view, has engaged in a much deeper integration with the underlying platforms. This gives Titanium developers the ability to leverage native UI components & services, as well as near-native performance, features you won't find in other cross-platform mobile development solution. In addition, you'll have access to other features like:

* Platform specific APIs

* Location-based services

* Social sharing

* Rich multimedia

* Online and on-device data

* Extensibility

* and much more!

Titanium empowers you to create immersive, full-featured applications that go beyond the boundaries of the browser. We do the heavy-lifting on cross platform compatibility so you don’t have to. Featuring over 80%code reuse across mobile apps, Titanium provides a deep, yet highly-reusable development platform. Appcelerator licenses Titanium under the Apache 2 license and is free for both personal and commercial use.

In this chapter, you'll and learn the basics of writing cross-platform mobile apps with Titanium and become familiar with resources available to you. In addition, we'll take a brief look at the JavaScript skills you'll need to be an effective Titanium developer.
