In order to use Titanium and Angular together you need to have the latest Appcelerator CLI and Titanium SDK nightly builds installed. You can do so by running the following commands from your terminal:

**Install Appcelerator CLI with Angular support**

```bash
# Latest CLI
appc use 7.0.3-X

# Latest SDK
appc ti sdk install -b master
```

## Open Source

Make sure to also check out the [titanium-angular](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium-angular) repository on GitHub, which includes the most active state of the Angular support in Titanium.
