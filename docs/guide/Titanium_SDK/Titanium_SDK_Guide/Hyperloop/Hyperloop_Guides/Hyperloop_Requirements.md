# Hyperloop Requirements

## Requirements

You’ll need to have the following installed on your machine as the recommended requirements to use Hyperloop 5.0.0+:

* Appcelerator Studio: 5.0.0+

* Titanium SDK: 9.0.0+

* Appcelerator CLI: 7.0.0+

You can install [Appcelerator Studio](https://platform.axway.com/#/product/studio) and [Appcelerator CLI](https://platform.axway.com/#/product/cli) to get the latest version of all these components.

### Optional Dependencies

These dependencies are used only if you plan to integrate hyperloop with them. You **do not** need Alloy or Cocoapods to use Hyperloop, but may use Hyperloop in an Alloy app - or consume 3rd-party libraries on iOS using Cocoapods.

* Alloy 1.8.0+

* [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) 1.0.0+ (see note)

Note: If you plan on using CocoaPods as a third-party dependencies manager, you will need to have (at a minimum) CocoaPods 1.0.0 or later installed. See [Using third-party libraries with CocoaPods](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Hyperloop/Hyperloop_Guides/iOS_Hyperloop_Programming_Guide/#cocoapods) for details on how to install and set up your project.

## Installation

### Appcelerator Studio

To download and install Appcelerator Studio:

1. Log in to [https://platform.axway.com/](https://platform.axway.com/).

2. Expand the Appcelerator menu ![appc_menu](/images/guide/download/thumbnails/30083017/appc_menu.png) and click on the [App Builder](https://platform.axway.com/#/product/studio) link.

3. Click on the installer for your OS. Wait a moment while the installer downloads.

4. Launch the downloaded installer and follow the steps to install. If the installer asks to install a specific version of Java, allow it. See [Titanium Compatibility Matrix#JavaDevelopmentKit](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix/#java-development-kit) for details on which versions we support.

### Titanium SDK

Titanium SDK is included in the installation of Appcelerator Studio.

### Appcelerator CLI

Refer to [Setting up the Appcelerator CLI](/guide/Appcelerator_CLI/Appcelerator_CLI_Getting_Started/) for instructions and preparation for installing Appcelerator CLI.

### Alloy Framework

The Alloy command-line interface and plugin will be automatically installed by Appcelerator Studio or the Appcelerator CLI.
