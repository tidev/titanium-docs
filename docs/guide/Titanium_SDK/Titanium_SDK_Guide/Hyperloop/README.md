# Hyperloop

## Introduction

Hyperloop gives you direct access to the native APIs. Titanium SDK already covers plenty of the native APIs and makes them cross-platform addressing the most popular APIs. This technology was built for those developers who require access to even the most obscure APIs out there.
Hyperloop is available on all Platform tiers and apps that are registered with the AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services.

## Requirements

Refer to [Hyperloop Requirements](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Hyperloop/Hyperloop_Guides/Hyperloop_Requirements/) for instructions on what and how to install the necessary requirements for Hyperloop.

## Installation

Please refer to the [Enabling Hyperloop](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Hyperloop/Enabling_Hyperloop/) guide.

## Sample projects

See [Hyperloop Sample Apps](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Hyperloop/Hyperloop_Sample_Apps/) page for details on how to build a Hyperloop app.

## Getting Started

Make sure to follow the [Hyperloop Guides](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Hyperloop/Hyperloop_Guides/) section for deep-dives on how to use the native platforms in Titanium.
