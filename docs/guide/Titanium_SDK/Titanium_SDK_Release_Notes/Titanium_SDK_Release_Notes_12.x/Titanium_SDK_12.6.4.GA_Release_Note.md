# Titanium SDK 12.6.4.GA Release Note

## About this release

Titanium SDK 12.6.4 is a patch release of the SDK, fixing the compatibility with Xcode 16.3 and later.
Please make sure to use this version in order to build apps for iOS 18.4 and later, as Apple has
introduced a breaking change affecting the discovery of simulators between Xcode 16.2 and 16.3.

As of this GA release, the previous Titanium SDK patch release (12.6.3) is no longer supported.
