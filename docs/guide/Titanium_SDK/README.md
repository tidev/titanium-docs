# Titanium SDK

The Titanium SDK helps you to build native cross-platform mobile application using JavaScript and the Titanium API, which abstracts the native APIs of the mobile platforms. Titanium empowers you to create immersive, full-featured applications, featuring over 80% code reuse across mobile apps. TiDev licenses Titanium under the OSI approved Apache Public License (Version 2) and is free for both personal and commercial use.
