# Introduction

The Titanium Platform allows you to create, run, and package native mobile applications for iOS and Android devices using our cross-platform JavaScript APIs. Mobile applications built with the Titanium SDK are run against a standalone JavaScript engine which invokes native APIs. As a developer, you are in fact writing a native application–it's just that you're using cross-platform JavaScript rather than non-portable Java or Objective-C.
