# Viewing Analytics

## Analytics tab for client services

The **Analytics** tab lets you view detailed analytics for each application. The **Analytics** tab contains several sub-tabs to view different metric categories and create event funnels and queries. Each sub-tab is explained below.

### Real-time tab

The **Real-Time** tab displays the number of currently active sessions, as well as the number of installs, sessions, and the average session length over the last hour. Note that all times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

**Active Users** - The number of users in the application at the moment.

**Installs** - The number of application installs within the past 15 minutes.

**Sessions** - The number of users in the application within the past 15 minutes.

**Events** - The number of events generated by the application within the past 15 minutes.

The real-time analytics information can be filtered by version and environment.

By analyzing event funnel data, you can identify, for example, where users drop out of the purchase process. For instructions on creating and viewing event funnels, see [Appcelerator Analytics: Creating and Viewing Event Funnels](/guide/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Guide/Appcelerator_Analytics/#CreatingandViewingEventFunnels).

To filter data for a specific time interval, either select one of the predefined options or specify a custom start and end date/time. To use the custom date/time range filter:

![time_period_ranges](./time_period_ranges.png)

1. Click on the date filter and select a granularity level from the granularity drop-down list.

    1. **Last 3 Months**: aggregate results by the last three months.

    2. **Last 30 Days**: aggregate results by the last 30 days.

    3. **Last 7 Days**: aggregate results by the last seven days.

    4. **Last 24 Hours**: aggregate results by day.

    5. **Last 60 Minutes**: aggregate results by the last 60 minutes.

2. To set a custom time range, click on one of the calendar date fields.

4. If the dates selected are less than four days apart, you also need to select a start time and end time with the time picker.

5. Click **Set**.

The data on the dashboard page will be updated based on the newly set date/time range filter. Note that the filters you select persist when navigating through the Dashboard.

## Export data

You can export chart and table data to CSV format to use in other programs, such as Microsoft Excel, to analyze offline.

1. To export data, first select the data you want to export, including the time frame, version, and environment. The data frequency is based on the granularity level selected in the custom date/time range filter.

2. Click the **Action Menu** icon, then select either:

    1. **Refresh** - To refresh the data export and the displayed analytics information**.** The elapsed time since the last data refresh is displayed.

    2. **Chart** - To export the data in the chart.

    3. **Table** - To export the data from the table.

    ![export_data](./export_data.png)

Once you select the export option, your data download begins.

In the example below, session data over a custom time interval for all the organization's projects were exported. Since the granularity level for the data/time range file is set to daily, each data point in the table is also daily.

## Unspecified metric names and values

In some cases, a metric's value may be unknown to the Dashboard analytics engine. In such cases, a placeholder value – "(not set)" – or placeholder is displayed instead. The following describes why, when, and where these placeholder values appear.

### Platform icons for Mobile Backend Services requests

In the metrics for Mobile Backend Services Requests, if a Mobile Backend Services API call originated from a source other than a Titanium application or native iOS application using AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services SDK, an icon is displayed. For instance, this icon would appear for calls made to the Mobile Backend Services APIs using a command-line tool, such as cURL.

### Version and environment values for Crash and Test metrics

When viewing Test and Crash analytics, the **Version** and **Environment** drop-down menus display "(not set)" since version and environment are not available. For the same reason, graphs that display a version series of Crash or Test metrics will display "(not set)"

### Geographic analysis

On a metric's **Geo** tab, if the country could not be determined from the metric's included geographic coordinates or coordinates were not provided at all, "(not set)" is displayed as the Country name.
