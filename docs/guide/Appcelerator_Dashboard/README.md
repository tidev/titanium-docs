# Appcelerator Dashboard

## Introduction

AMPLIFY Dashboard (Appcelerator Dashboard) is a web application you use to manage all aspects of your AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services development. You can manage Titanium applications, as well as iOS and Android applications built with Objective-C (or Swift) and Java. It enables you to create, deliver, analyze, and manage your mobile apps. Using the Dashboard, you can do the following:

* Manage client applications, including Android and iOS application

    * Register an Android or iOS application with the AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services (see [Managing Non-Titanium Client Applications in Dashboard](/guide/Appcelerator_Dashboard/Appcelerator_Dashboard_Guide/Managing_Applications/Managing_Client_Applications/Managing_Non-Titanium_Client_Applications_in_Dashboard/))

    * Download the AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services SDK and Appcelerator Studio

* Manage organizations and application teams (see [Managing Organizations](/guide/Appcelerator_Dashboard/Appcelerator_Dashboard_Guide/Managing_Organizations/))

* View application metrics and analytics (see [Managing Client Applications: Analytics](/guide/Appcelerator_Dashboard/Appcelerator_Dashboard_Guide/Managing_Applications/Managing_Client_Applications/#Analytics))

    * View key metric counts and trends

    * Track user engagement, retention and feature usage for your application

    * Create and monitor event "funnels" to monitor critical user flows

* Monitor Cloud API usage for each application or an organization as a whole

    * Add, modify and delete Cloud objects for specific applications (see [Managing Mobile Backend Services data objects](/guide/Appcelerator_Dashboard/Appcelerator_Dashboard_Guide/Managing_Applications/Managing_Mobile_Backend_Services_Datasources/Managing_Mobile_Backend_Services_data_objects/))

    * Configure push notifications services (see [Configuring Cloud Services](/guide/Appcelerator_Dashboard/Appcelerator_Dashboard_Guide/Configuring_Cloud_Services/))

    * View API Builder application statistics (see [Viewing Custom Cloud Services](/guide/Appcelerator_Dashboard/Appcelerator_Dashboard_Guide/Viewing_Custom_Cloud_Services/))

* Google Chrome 55+
