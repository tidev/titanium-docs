# Dashboard 4.2.0

Dashboard 4.2.0 is a minor release, which includes behavior changes, new features, improvements and bug fixes.

## Behavior Changes

* Renamed "Cloud API Calls (Pre-built)" to "ArrowDB Requests," and "Cloud API Calls (Custom)" to "Arrow Requests."

* Removed the "Last 365 Days" pre-set option in the date filter and added a "Last 3 Months" pre-set option. If you want to see 365 days, use a custom date range.

* Removed the **Analytics** tab for Arrow applications and replaced it with an **Overview** page. See the "New Features" section for details on the Overview page.

    1. Click the **Profile** menu

    2. Click the **Profile** item

    3. Click **Change** next to the Email field to initiate the e-mail address change.

    4. Check your inbox for an e-mail from the Appcelerator Platform to change your e-mail address.

* Added an **Overview** page for Arrow applications, which displays build and status information about the Arrow application as well as the information that was present in the Analytics tab.

## Fixed Issues

* Fixed redirect links that include a path, query or hash sign

* Fixed "What is the APS SDK?" link
