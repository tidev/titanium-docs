# Dashboard 4.7.0 - 30 April 2016

Dashboard 4.7.0 is a minor release, which includes new features, improvements, and several bug fixes.

## New Features

* Dashboard users may now sign in with their Github accounts.

* Organizations which have purchased a license of Appcelerator Private may now access ArrowCloud installer executables, VMWare images, and documentation from the Downloads section of Dashboard.

## Improvements

* Dashboard users in organizations which have not created any applications are presented with an improved page, linking to instructions on downloading the latest tools, and how to migrate existing apps. The "no apps" page will only be shown once for the user's session and may be permanently dismissed.

* The All Projects page and navigation now show an icon for each type of project.

## Fixed Issues

* Preceding and trailing spaces in app names are now trimmed prior to saving.

* Fixed issue where the delete modal was affecting the padding of the body.

* Fixed issue where the number of members of an organization may exceed the allowed seats.
