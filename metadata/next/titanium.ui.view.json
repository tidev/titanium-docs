A child view is positioned based on its\npositioning properties or &quot;pins&quot;  (<code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code> and <code>center</code>).\nIf no positioning  properties are specified, the child is centered.</p>\n<p>The child is always sized based on its <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties, if these are\nspecified.  If the child's height or width is <em>not</em> specified explicitly, it may be\ncalculated implicitly from the positioning properties. For example, if both <code>left</code> and\n<code>center.x</code> are specified, they can be used to calculate the width of the child control.</p>\n<p>Because the size and position properties can conflict, there is a specific precedence\norder for the layout properties.  For vertical positioning, the precedence\norder is: <code>height</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>center.y</code>, <code>bottom</code>.</p>\n<p>The following table summarizes the various combinations of properties that can\nbe used for vertical positioning, in order from highest precedence to lowest.\n(For example, if <code>height</code>, <code>center.y</code> and <code>bottom</code> are all specified, the\n<code>height</code> and <code>center.y</code> values take precedence.)</p>\n<table class=\"doc-table\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Scenario</th>\n      <th>Behavior</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>height</code> & <code>top</code> specified</td>\n      <td>\n        Child positioned <code>top</code> unit from parent's top, using specified <code>height</code>;\n        any <code>center.y</code> and <code>bottom</code> values are ignored.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>height</code> & <code>center.y</code> specified</td>\n      <td>\n        Child positioned with center at <code>center.y</code>, using specified <code>height</code>;\n        any <code>bottom</code> value is ignored.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>height</code> & <code>bottom</code> specified</td>\n      <td>Child positioned <code>bottom</code> units from parent's bottom, using specified <code>height</code>.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>top</code> & <code>center.y</code> specified</td>\n      <td>\n        Child positioned with top edge <code>top</code> units from parent's top and center at\n        <code>center.y</code>.

Children are laid out vertically from top to bottom. The first child\nis laid out <code>top</code> units from its parent's bounding box. Each subsequent child is\nlaid out below the previous child. The space between children is equal to the\nupper child's <code>bottom</code> value plus the lower child's <code>top</code> value.</p>\n<p>Each child is positioned horizontally as in the composite layout mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>horizontal</code>. Horizontal layouts have different behavior depending on whether wrapping\nis enabled. Wrapping is enabled by default (the <code>horizontalWrap</code> property is <code>true</code>).</p>\n<p>With wrapping behavior, the children are laid out horizontally from left to right,\n<em>in rows</em>. If a child requires more horizontal space than exists in the current row,\nit is wrapped to a new row. The height of each row is equal to the maximum height of\nthe children in that row.</p>\n<p>Wrapping behavior is available on iOS and Android. When the <code>horizontalWrap</code> property is\nset to true, the first row is placed at the top of the parent view, and successive rows\nare placed below the first row. Each child is positioned vertically <em>within its row</em> somewhat\nlike composite layout mode. In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If neither <code>top</code> or <code>bottom</code> is specified, the child is centered in the\nrow.</li>\n<li>If either <code>top</code> or <code>bottom</code> is specified, the child is aligned to either\nthe top or bottom of the row, with the specified amount of padding.</li>\n<li>If <em>both</em> <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> is specified for a given child, the properties\nare both treated as padding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the <code>horizontalWrap</code> property is false, the behavior is more equivalent to a vertical layout.\nChildren are laid or horizontally from left to right in a single row. The <code>left</code> and\n<code>right</code> properties are used as padding between the children, and the <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code>\nproperties are used to position the children vertically.</p>\n<p>Defaults to Composite layout.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","platforms":[{"since":"0.9","name":"android"},{"since":"0.9","name":"iphone"},{"since":"0.9","name":"ipad"},{"since":"9.2.0","name":"macos"}],"type":"String"},{"name":"left","summary":"<p>View's left position, in platform-specific units.</p>\n","description":"<p>This position is relative to the view's parent.
